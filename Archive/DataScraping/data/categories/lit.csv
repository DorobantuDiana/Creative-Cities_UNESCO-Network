Currently, the city boasts 250 writers of literary fiction and over 100 guilds, publishers and booksellers who are at the heart of the revival of Quebec literature.
Numerous poetry evenings, thematic walks, festivals and other events take place throughout the year in Québec.

In 2015, the Maison de la littérature, a centre for outreach and the dissemination of literature that is unique in North America, opened its doors in the heart of Old Québec.
In 2014, seeking to make Québec a bold cultural capital, the municipal government consulted with the art scene on its vision for developing the art-form in Québec. The outcome was a document entitled ‘2025 Cultural Development Vision’, in which the City undertakes to incorporate culture into the daily lives of all citizens, strengthen synergies between creators, invest in culture, conduct outreach and develop a favourable ecosystem for writers and artists. To achieve this, it regularly renews its support programmes for the artistic and literary scenes.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Literature, Québec envisages:
