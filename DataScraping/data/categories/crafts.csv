1,"About the Creative City: As the second largest city after the capital Lomé, Sokodé, a city of 95,070 inhabitants, is renowned for the art of weaving, an activity that is highly regarded among craftsmen and women. Although intended to produce the day-to-day clothing of the city’s inhabitants, the weavers’ wrappers are also used to sow the tunics and large embroidered boubous that Tem knights wear on festival days. Weaving accounts for over 35% of all activity among the many guilds within the craft sector of Sokodé. The strength and dynamism of the craft sector are major drivers of the local economy and contribute significantly to the income of both the city and the country.
Sokodé hosts major events that play a role in promoting the crafts and folk art sector, including the Togo Sokodé International Fair, the Togo Craft Fair and annual events such as the Gadao-Adossa Festival. The name Gadao-Adossa is the common term designating two major festivals, namely Gadao for the Tem, and Adossa for the community of Didaouré. Sokodé also hosts the Inter-Professional Grouping of Craftsmen and Women of Togo (GIPATO), a national weavers’ training centre, which is currently training a number of trainees in new methods for weaving wrappers and traditional clothing.
The Sokodé municipality, through its 2015-2019 Communal Development Plan, has established culture as a priority for sustainable urban development through two programmes. The first seeks to promote local tourism, crafts and the historical values of the commune through the organisation of a number of training workshops supporting craftsmen and women in the development of their businesses and a feasibility study for the setting in place of food-processing and semi-traditional crafts units. The second programme envisages the building of a communal museum, supporting the organisation of cultural festivals and building a large capacity auditorium.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Sokodé envisages:
implementing the Projet SOS Artisanat [SOS Crafts Project] to promote the know-how and craft trades and to encourage younger generations and excluded women to become involved in the sector to make it a strategic socio-economic sustainable development tool;
helping to revitalise and promote the works of craftsmen and women and artists through the creation of a crafts and folk art farm in the Central Region;
fostering the participation of other Creative Cities in the Foire Artisanale et Culturelle de Sokodé [Crafts and Culture Fair], organised annually to promote socio-economic development based on crafts and culture, skills-promotion and capacity-building; and
implementing a joint-working framework, to enable dialogue among craftsmen and women on current and future issues facing the crafts and folk art sector, sharing experience, presenting and promoting concepts and stimulating research."
2,"About the Creative City: Durán, a city of an approximate 500,000 inhabitants, is known as the “Railway Town of Ecuador” thanks to its history as the first railroad hub of the country. As the main meeting point between the highlands and the coast of Ecuador, Durán has retained its heritage through the localised exchange of cultural practices and knowledge, which has impacted several of its current forms of folk art, especially urban art. Deeply rooted in this historical legacy, the city considers culture and creativity as mediums for collective memory, urban well-being, and social cohesion.
Since 2007, the Festival Memories of the Railroad has been held annually in honour of the former railway workers of the ancient Eloy Alfaro Railroad. The event has given rise to an ongoing two-year project undertaken by the municipality called History on Frontages. This scheme gives free rein to the local artists and allows them to paint one hundred murals on house frontages illustrating the history of the city. With strong participation from the youth, the city sees urban art as a tool for civic awareness and demonstrates this by the implementation of a second initiative entitled Youth for Human Rights involving more than 150 young artists.
Through a variety of artistic forms, Durán hosts many cultural events to establish links between modern creative fields and historical customs and folk art. With the aim of sustaining the city’s cultural heritage and nurturing its rich history, Cultural Nights is a flagship project supported by the municipality which showcases works by local artists. The Durán Convention Centre Luis Sánchez Borja also plays a prominent part in fostering the city’s cultural life, turning this once industrial city into a lively place for creativity to thrive.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Durán envisages:
increasing the number of cultural events to foster the diversity and quality of the cultural offerings and the capacity to participate in cultural creation;
nurturing the city’s identity, history and heritage through the implementation of the projects Memories of the Railway and History of Frontages, aimed at providing creative spaces to local artists;
encouraging youth and people from vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to participate in the city’s cultural life and to nurture social inclusion and civic awareness; and
enhancing cooperation at the local and the international levels by exchanging best practices with other Creative Cities of Crafts and Folk Art."
4,"About the Creative City: Porto-Novo (pop. 300,000) is the capital of Benin and one of the oldest cities in the country. Building on its colonial past and migratory flows recorded over the centuries, Porto- Novo possesses a unique cultural identity and a creative social dynamic based on sharing and peaceful coexistence. Artisanship in the city of Porto-Novo is highly diverse and organised, with 42 craft guilds. Moreover, families have specialised in specific crafts such as blacksmithing, pottery, wickerwork and the manufacture of musical instruments. The participation of artists and artisans and women in reflection on the city is vital in order to develop a sustainable city project. Through their creativity, they help anchor cultural values, togetherness and cohesion in urban development projects.
The city has organised the first International Festival of Arts and Culture of Porto-Novo. It has also hosted and supported a number of cultural events such as the Festival-Ateliers Éclosions Urbaines [Urban Outbreak Festival-Workshops], a public forum for the expression and exhibition of contemporary art in Porto-Novo. The festival brought together several artists to work on renovating and upgrading the city’s traditional squares. The 4th Porto-Novo West-African Urban Planning Workshops Event had also united architects, geographers, landscape gardeners, sociologists and artists, working jointly on the theme ‘Porto-Novo, Green City’.
As a prelude to the roll-out of its 2015-2019 Municipal Development Plan, Porto-Novo Municipality organised the Forum des forces vives de la cité [Forum on the City’s Vital Forces] in September 2010 to develop Porto-Novo based on the theme of ‘Porto-Novo, City of the Future’. The 2015- 2019 Municipal Plan identified, among the chief restrictions associated with developing the art and craft sectors, the lack of training of craftsmen and women and the lack of resources for the development of arts and crafts, along with the absence of a municipal policy to promote arts and crafts. In this regard, the city is seeking to increase the ways in which culture can play a role to make it an engine for human and urban development.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Porto-Novo envisages:
implementing a strategy to revitalise art, culture and tourism, working jointly with cultural actors to foster the emergence of a mechanism for the participation of artists in regional promotion and development, and to support local foundational artistic creation projects in the area of crafts and folk art;
developing youth training programmes for crafts, and capacity-building for artists notably through the use of new technologies;
consolidating the Porto-Novo International Festival and making it an event that promotes local arts and crafts with the participation of other Creative Cities;
developing cooperation with other cities in the Network within a framework of concrete, inclusive projects that foster a dynamic of togetherness among peoples and South-South and North-South cooperation;
enhancing the visibility of UNESCO and promoting actions in the field of crafts and folk art; and
creating links between Beninese and international actors in crafts and folk art."

To preserve and maintain these long-lasting traditions in crafts and folk arts, Aswan also has several institutions such as the Aswan Museum and the Nubia Museum, which houses an anthropology department focusing on the preservation of the folk arts from Aswan. The city also organizes numerous events celebrating the local culture drawing artists from around the world, such as the International Symposium of Sculpture which focuses on reviving the Egyptian art of carving on the hard stone of Aswan. 
 
Aswan’s museums, International Symposium of Sculpture and the Aswan Folk Troupe are illustrations of the local community’s efforts to support sustainable development, mutual understanding and the fight against poverty and illiteracy though culture and creativity.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Aswan envisages:

Viljandi takes pride in assimilating heritage in contemporary society, and thus preserving and developing local and national culture through modern methods, with the emphasis on cooperation on a national and international scale. In order to support the creative sector, the city provides financial support in form of stipend to its professional artists and craftspeople living and working in Viljandi. This is to provide members of the creative industry with a basic income to allow them to work full-time on their creative endeavours, as well as to publish and promote their work. The stipend is allocated four times a year, and whilst it is not designated specially for professionals in the folk arts field, the funding provides vital economic support for those in the industry.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Viljandi envisages:

19,"About the Creative City: With 400,000 inhabitants, Tétouan is the second largest economic hub in the Tanger-Tétouan-Al Hoceima region in Morocco. Craft activities date back to the foundation of the city in the 15th century. They still have an influence in the city itself through urban planning that establishes craft neighbourhoods encompassing Zellige, Taajira embroidery, encrusted and painted wood and wrought ironwork. Building on its Arab- Andalusian heritage, the arts and craftwork of Tétouan is set apart by a unique know-how perpetuated by its master-craftsmen and women.

Crafts are a unifying activity for communities, as well as being established as an active tertiary sector that has shown itself capable of renewal through the interest of artists and researchers. A number of local events in Tétouan, namely the craft forum Rencontres des artisans, offer a platform for public discussion on development of the sector. Each year on the fringes of the Women’s Voices International Music Festival, local crafts led by women are showcased at the pop-up event Marché au fil du temps.
As part of Tétouan’s Urban Development Programme, which seeks to restructure and upgrade under-equipped neighbourhoods, 8 libraries and three 3 local community spaces have been built, thereby providing unique venues to promote access to culture for all, notably for young people. In 2016, in the craft sector, Tétouan’s Municipality fostered and supported the creation of the federation of craft guilds, which provided considerable support to structure the sector and enable networking among its various actors.

35,"About the Creative City: Influenced by the presence of the samurai and their lifestyle, Kanazawa is recognized for its many artisan workshops characterizing the city as a City of Crafts and Folk Arts. Crafts and the samurai-influenced culture continue to play an important part of citizens’ daily lives.

This combination is what makes Kanazawa’s crafts unique. 
 
Today, many fields of craftwork continue to exist and have significantly contributed to improving people’s daily lives. Some examples are the kaga-yuzen silk dying technique which is still used for making kimonos or gold leaf and lacquer ware.

Currently, various training centres set up by the State, the municipality and professional guilds transmit artisanship. For example, the Centre national d’artisanat et d’art [National Centre for Arts and Crafts], the Village Artisanal de Ouagadougou [Craft Village], the Vitrine du Bronze [Bronze Display] and the Lukaré Centre offer young people training programmes to ensure continuity in a dynamic dialogue between heritage and creativity. The city hosts two major two-yearly cultural events: the Ouagadougou International Craft Fair (SIAO) and the Ouagadougou Pan-African Cinema and Television Festival (FESPACO).
To support local cultural industries, the Ouagadougou city council places an emphasis on the professional accreditation of young artists through the organisation of technical training, and on improving their working conditions with the building of multi-use cultural complexes including production facilities, an auditorium, and training spaces (Reemdoogo 1, Palais JP Guingané, Maison du Peuple). The municipal government is aware of the importance of bronze-working and has created the Vitrine du Bronze [Bronze Display] to permanently establish and promote the craft and to encourage the sale of its products on markets. As an important driver of the local creative economy, the municipality has pursued a craft revitalisation policy that establishes Niongsin as an iconic neighbourhood in this respect.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Ouagadougou envisages:

The Mosaic Festival for example, launched in 2014 in partnership with Middle East University, aims to promote the mosaic industry and tessellation work of local craftsmen. In 2016 Madaba was bestowed the title of Mosaic City by the World Crafts Council.
As part of a partnership between the Municipality of Madaba, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, the Mosaic Workshops Instructions have been established to raise awareness and train craftsmen and stakeholders in responsible and sustainable approaches of the mosaic industry. The workshops focus notably at preventing illegal exportation of mosaic antiquities by labelling them as modern artworks, as well as at strengthening artisans’ rights and working conditions through safe work environment, health insurance and social security systems.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Madaba envisages:

The crafts and folk arts have drawn on this migration mélange to form a distinct culture, whilst showing clear kinship with the contributory streams. Bahamian cultural forms may thus be viewed as a bridge between the cultural complexes of the two regions.
Junkanoo and straw art are among the most outstanding Bahamian creative and cultural traditions. Firmly grounded in Bahamian history and heritage, the Junkanoo masquerade tradition has had a significant positive impact on the development and preservation of the country’s indigenous arts and crafts. At the same time, it has privileged creativity and resourcefulness in the use of available materials and has provided an avenue to greater economic independence for generations of Bahamians. Through the development of the local creative economy and exchange with other Creative Cities, Nassau plans to diversify its economy and increase participation in cultural life.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Arts, Nassau envisages:
forging stronger relationships with UCCN cities via electronic media;
hosting  UCCN conferences;
sharing historical and educational information on the Bahamian straw and Junkanoo traditions in addition to fostering educational exchange programmes on this topic;
strengthening the city’s relationship with Santa Fe, fellow Creative City of Crafts and Folk Arts,  with which it has already developed an active partnership; and
acting as a conduit for the promotion of the UCCN and the creative tourism model throughout the Caribbean region."
159,"About the Creative City: Located at the heart of the Italian Textile Valley, Como is founded on its patrimonial textile industry. The city aspires to pass on this deep-rooted traditions and artistic skills from generation to generation, while continuing to improve technique and manufacturing potential. This is thanks to Como’s constant push for innovation, which is ensured by the support of excellent training centres, and promoted by the commitment and creativity of the industry's artisans and textile manufacturers. The industry focuses on intricate and complex production methods, where the art of silk craft, along with the tradition of sericulture, play a fundamental role.
Como's textile industry is backed by scientific input from a host of exceptional training institutions, such as the Setificio school, the oldest textile school in Italy established in 1868 and the only one to offer a course in textile design; the University of Insubria, which promotes research, innovation, and sustainability in its textile chemistry courses; the Silk Museum, which preserves the traditions of the industry’s production methods; and the ""Ratti"" Foundation, home to a prized art collection and monumental textiles archive.
Underlining the importance of the city’s industrial base, today about 70% of European silk is produced in the Como district, and the city is proudly home to about 1,400 silk companies, which provides employment for over 15,000 people. The turnover of the textile district is estimated at USD 2.28 billion, providing not only financial resources, but cultural and social interaction for many of the city’s residents.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, the following steps will be important:

165,"About the Creative City: The second largest city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with 1.7 million inhabitants, Lubumbashi is situated along the mining region of the Copperbelt. As the copper and malachite industries have long been the backbones of the local economy, Lubumbashi is committed to giving new impetus to the city’s development by using creativity to highlight its industrial legacy. With more than 50 workshops dedicated to malachite carving, city policies reflect the trade’s stature as a key lever to stimulate employment.
Workers from the copper mines have anchored many artistic expressions in the city’s cultural identity, from street performance to popular theatre and music including karindula and brakka. This vast amount of creativity has led to the creation of the Copper Eaters Festival, which for the last fifteen years has celebrated artisan work. This event is central to the city’s strategy to foster urban vitality, cultural participation and social cohesion. In addition, the city hosts the Picha Encounters, also referred to as the Lubumbashi Biennale for Visual Arts, which is known as one of the most innovative and experimental cultural events in Africa for showcasing urban-related works of art.
So far, culture and creativity within the city has been developing in the informal sphere. However, the Municipality, together with civil society, is keen to work towards developing a comprehensive policy framework for culture. Current measures facilitate the establishment of cultural organizations and creative industries, as well as increase the number of training programmes and job opportunities for artists and artisans. Lubumbashi is eager to develop its networks further with the aim of allowing this post-industrial city to advance with a sustainable urban renewal and development path, using culture and creativity as a driver.","Added Value: As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Lubumbashi envisages:
