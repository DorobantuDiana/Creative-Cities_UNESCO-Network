<h2 style="color: #007bff;">🏙️ Exploring Creative Cities in the UNESCO Network 🎨</h2>

<p style="font-style: italic;">This project is centered around the exploration of cities within the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN). This initiative was born from a data‐driven approach, utilizing data science techniques and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and insights within the descriptions of these creative urban environments.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Through examining how living environments influence activities and mental states, I gained valuable insights into the complex interplay between urban landscapes and human behavior. This project not only delved into the distinctive atmosphere of creative cities but also aimed to pinpoint their essential characteristics and their impact on individuals’ well‐being.</p>
