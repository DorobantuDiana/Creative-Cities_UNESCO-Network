A vivid example is the Aitys, an impromptu contest of two singers (akins) performing folk poetry accompanied by stringed instruments. Building upon a rich musical legacy, Almaty was the home of nationally renowned composers Ahmet and Gaziza Zhubanov and Erkegali\u00a0Rakhmadiev. Music in Almaty has strong local support and citizens are keen to be involved in the sector.As a key component to Almaty\u00b4s urban culture, music spreads through a hundred open-air events held annually, including the AlmaFest. This festival built around the apple symbol of the city, integrates music, folk art and gastronomy through performance. The city also hosted the Colisium International Music Conference; a large-scale forum dedicated to discussing the latest trends of the concert industry as well as to exchanging knowledge between international and local music artists and professionals.When developing the Almaty 2020 Development Programme, a number of issues in the creative sector were identified, particularly that of insufficient technical equipment within cultural institutions and a lack of qualified specialists in the field of cultural management. As a result, the City has provided these facilities with modern equipment, and in 2016, new musical infrastructure was built, including the Multimedia Traditional Music Centre and the Alatau Theatre of Traditional Art. At the same time, the City has effectively supported young professionals and artists through several grants and scholarships. Almaty is strongly committed to further developing its creative sector as a resource for the city, enabling it to enter a new stage of development, one that would be inclusive and sustainable. As a Creative City of Music, Almaty envisages:organising an open-air Music Festival of Orchestras to showcase local and national orchestras;holding an open-air Music Festival called Gakku Dauysy, aimed at promoting Kazakh pop music and singers, exploring the roots of modern musical practices;organising the Almaty KokTobe Opera, seeking to familiarise residents and visitors with prominent international opera singers and masterpieces of classical music;setting up the international programme Spirit of the Great Steppe, aimed at promoting historical and cultural values of the nomadic people; andlaunching the Star of Asia programme aiming to raise awareness about little known customs and traditions of Asia countries.",

For centuries, the city has been a major centre of cultural life, retaining to this day, its historic prominence with major cultural sites, including the Giza pyramid complex. Historically known as a hub of renowned craftsmanship, Cairo celebrates this heritage within its historic centre by calling the neighbourhoods after different craft practices. The local creative economy mainly relies on the vitality of the crafts and folk art sector which represent 80% of the city\u2019s cultural activities.Communities living in the historic centre are key in the continued support of crafts and folk art within the city. Throughout the years, they initiated craftsmen guilds specializing in pottery, glassblowing, coppersmith, ceramic and jewellery. To promote their artworks and know-how, the City organises a wide range of fairs such as the Diarna Fair or the Youm Misr (A day in Egypt); the first fair dedicated to promoting the craft heritage of Cairo. The City also hosts the Heritage Forum, aimed at increasing awareness around the creative sector. The International Festival of Drums and Traditional Arts is also a flagship event linking traditional folk art and music practices.In the early 20th century, Cairo bore witness to a rapid urbanization due to rural exodus. This resulted in a numberof residents moving into the city outskirts, leaving aninactive historic centre behind. To revive the area, the Urban Regeneration Project for Historic Cairo has identied culture and creativity as key enablers in restoring the heritage and culture of the once prestigious area. Alongside this, the Creative Cairo strategy focuses on establishing participatory mechanisms to engage citizens in all steps of the regeneration process of the historic centre. As a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art, Cairo envisages:organising a series of specialised training sessions designed to strengthen artisans capacities and quality of crafts products;developing a design for a multipurpose urban square, offering periodical markets for exhibitions and selling of craft products;restoring and repurposing public buildings for Community Craft Centres;advocating and promoting the importance and value of cultural centres initiated by citizens and artists as open spaces for creation; andengaging in partnerships with other UCCN members through the Creative Cairo strategy, providing professional development and international exchanges within Cairo\u2019s cultural sector.",
