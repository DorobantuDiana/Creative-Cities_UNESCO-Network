    "0": "About the Creative City:\u00a0The cultural sector and the creative industries have a strong position in Norway\u2019s economy. Three percent of Norway\u2019s working population are principally employed in cultural industries. It is in such an environment that Hamar, the largest city of Inland Norway, thrives on its creative industries. The city\u2019s cultural and creative sectors are large and frequently ranked, based on annual assessment carried out by the Government, as one of the leading cultural cities of Norway when it comes to relative size, impact on economy and range of activities. Hamar Municipality has invested strategically in infrastructure to facilitate the development of technology driven media arts and companies within creative industries. The city is considered as a national hub and an incubator for start-ups in media arts, especially related to interactive media, gamification and extended reality (XR). In Hamar, as many as 5.8 % of the workforce is engaged in creative industries and entities related to media arts. Both the number of start-ups, as well the size and type of new clusters being established addressing various technology driven media arts concepts are increasing. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an even stronger desire among many young people to view technology driven creativity and media arts as a plausible career, pushing forward further Hamar\u2019s development in media arts.",
    "1": "About the Creative City:\u00a0As the second largest city after the capital Lom\u00e9, Sokod\u00e9, a city of 95,070 inhabitants, is renowned for the art of weaving, an activity that is highly regarded among craftsmen and women. Although intended to produce the day-to-day clothing of the city\u2019s inhabitants, the weavers\u2019 wrappers are also used to sow the tunics and large embroidered boubous that Tem knights wear on festival days. Weaving accounts for over 35% of all activity among the many guilds within the craft sector of Sokod\u00e9. The strength and dynamism of the craft sector are major drivers of the local economy and contribute significantly to the income of both the city and the country.\nSokod\u00e9 hosts major events that play a role in promoting the crafts and folk art sector, including the Togo Sokod\u00e9 International Fair, the Togo Craft Fair and annual events such as the Gadao-Adossa Festival. The name Gadao-Adossa is the common term designating two major festivals, namely Gadao for the Tem, and Adossa for the community of Didaour\u00e9. Sokod\u00e9 also hosts the Inter-Professional Grouping of Craftsmen and Women of Togo (GIPATO), a national weavers\u2019 training centre, which is currently training a number of trainees in new methods for weaving wrappers and traditional clothing.\nThe Sokod\u00e9 municipality, through its 2015-2019 Communal Development Plan, has established culture as a priority for sustainable urban development through two programmes. The first seeks to promote local tourism, crafts and the historical values of the commune through the organisation of a number of training workshops supporting craftsmen and women in the development of their businesses and a feasibility study for the setting in place of food-processing and semi-traditional crafts units. The second programme envisages the building of a communal museum, supporting the organisation of cultural festivals and building a large capacity auditorium.",
    "2": "About the Creative City:\u00a0Dur\u00e1n, a city of an approximate 500,000 inhabitants, is known as the \u201cRailway Town of Ecuador\u201d thanks to its history as the first railroad hub of the country. As the main meeting point between the highlands and the coast of Ecuador, Dur\u00e1n has retained its heritage through the localised exchange of cultural practices and knowledge, which has impacted several of its current forms of folk art, especially urban art. Deeply rooted in this historical legacy, the city considers culture and creativity as mediums for collective memory, urban well-being, and social cohesion.\nSince 2007, the Festival Memories of the Railroad has been held annually in honour of the former railway workers of the ancient Eloy Alfaro Railroad. The event has given rise to an ongoing two-year project undertaken by the municipality called History on Frontages. This scheme gives free rein to the local artists and allows them to paint one hundred murals on house frontages illustrating the history of the city. With strong participation from the youth, the city sees urban art as a tool for civic awareness and demonstrates this by the implementation of a second initiative entitled Youth for Human Rights involving more than 150 young artists.\nThrough a variety of artistic forms, Dur\u00e1n hosts many cultural events to establish links between modern creative fields and historical customs and folk art. With the aim of sustaining the city\u2019s cultural heritage and nurturing its rich history, Cultural Nights is a flagship project supported by the municipality which showcases works by local artists. The Dur\u00e1n Convention Centre Luis S\u00e1nchez Borja also plays a prominent part in fostering the city\u2019s cultural life, turning this once industrial city into a lively place for creativity to thrive.",
    "3": "About the Creative City:\u00a0Dunedin is New Zealand\u2019s largest city by area and is renowned for its contrasting landscapes. It is a sprawling city that encompasses urban and rural communities. It is situated at the head of the Otago Harbour and stretches from the shores of the Pacific Ocean to the wilds of the Otago hinterland. This landscape has inspired poets and writers since the 19th century: including poet Thomas Bracken, author of New Zealand\u2019s national anthem; Charles Brasch, founder of Landfall, the country\u2019s foremost literary journal; and Janet Frame, internationally respected for her fiction and poetry.\nIn addition to Dunedin\u2019s impressive publishing heritage, the city is also home to many nationally significant libraries and book collections including the Dunedin Public Library, New Zealand\u2019s first free public library which was established in 1908. Additionally the Centre for the Book, opened in 2012, is a centre of excellence on book history and print culture, and investigates new platforms and models of book publication and distribution.\nThroughout the year, literature-related events contribute to the city\u2019s vibe such as the Dunedin Writers and Readers Festival, New Zealand Book Month and the Children\u2019s Storylines Festival.",
    "4": "About the Creative City:\u00a0Porto-Novo (pop. 300,000) is the capital of Benin and one of the oldest cities in the country. Building on its colonial past and migratory flows recorded over the centuries, Porto- Novo possesses a unique cultural identity and a creative social dynamic based on sharing and peaceful coexistence. Artisanship in the city of Porto-Novo is highly diverse and organised, with 42 craft guilds. Moreover, families have specialised in specific crafts such as blacksmithing, pottery, wickerwork and the manufacture of musical instruments. The participation of artists and artisans and women in reflection on the city is vital in order to develop a sustainable city project. Through their creativity, they help anchor cultural values, togetherness and cohesion in urban development projects.\nThe city has organised the first International Festival of Arts and Culture of Porto-Novo. It has also hosted and supported a number of cultural events such as the Festival-Ateliers \u00c9closions Urbaines [Urban Outbreak Festival-Workshops], a public forum for the expression and exhibition of contemporary art in Porto-Novo. The festival brought together several artists to work on renovating and upgrading the city\u2019s traditional squares. The 4th Porto-Novo West-African Urban Planning Workshops Event had also united architects, geographers, landscape gardeners, sociologists and artists, working jointly on the theme \u2018Porto-Novo, Green City\u2019.\nAs a prelude to the roll-out of its 2015-2019 Municipal Development Plan, Porto-Novo Municipality organised the Forum des forces vives de la cit\u00e9 [Forum on the City\u2019s Vital Forces] in September 2010 to develop Porto-Novo based on the theme of \u2018Porto-Novo, City of the Future\u2019. The 2015- 2019 Municipal Plan identified, among the chief restrictions associated with developing the art and craft sectors, the lack of training of craftsmen and women and the lack of resources for the development of arts and crafts, along with the absence of a municipal policy to promote arts and crafts. In this regard, the city is seeking to increase the ways in which culture can play a role to make it an engine for human and urban development.",
    "5": "About the Creative City:\u00a0Located at the foot of the Zao mountain range in Northeastern Japan, Yamagata (pop. 250,000) launched the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival (YIDFF) in 1989. This event is renowned for being the first international festival devoted to the documentary genre in Asia, and is the longest running event of its kind in the world and recording an annual audience of 24,000. Ogawa Shinsuke, the icon of the Japanese documentary and awarded by the Berlin International Film Festival, was influential in the creation of the festival, turning the city into a major film hub in Japan. The audiovisual sector, including film industry, comprises 150 companies generating a total income of US$441 billion.\nConsidering film and documentary genres as tools for rethinking societies and nurturing collective memory, Yamagata encourages young people to engage in the sector. In turn, this helps tackle the significant lack of employment opportunities for the young population. The YIDFF is being instrumental in providing film workshops, internships and international residency programmes by partnering with universities, including the Tohoku University of Art and Design. The Renaissance Project also showcases young talented filmmakers whose work focuses on shedding new light on traditional know-how, including of crafts and folk art and of gastronomy.\nYamagata is implementing its Action Plan for Cultural Promotion which identifies creative activities as a key driver for the city\u2019s socio-economic development. The plan provides support for grass-roots cultural activities that contribute to community-building. In the film sector, the Yamagata Film Commission has expanded since 2012 by including seven other cities in order to better serve and support the regional film industry. With an annual average of 60 visiting productions, this initiative has significantly raised Yamagata\u2019s profile as a city of film.",
    "6": "About the Creative City:\u00a0Since the 7th century B.C., the city of Essaouira has been an important regional centre for creativity. The UNESCO World Heritage listed Old Medina of Essaouira boasts exceptional spaces for cultural expression, where music takes on its full meaning.\nEssaouira is a major centre for intercultural dialogue and a symbol of tolerance, and is renowned for many cultural initiatives of both regional and international scope, serving to promote inclusion for the city's residents and for the province. Young people are active participants in the cultural and music industry of Essaouira. Currently, there are twelve regular music festivals and eleven music event companies created by young people from the city. T\nhe role of music has its roots in a historical tradition of mixed identities - Jewish, Muslim, Christian and animist, which is reflected in numerous major events. Among these are the Gnaoua World Music Festival and the Atlantic Andalusia Festival. Soon to be completed is the Mohammed VI City for Arts and Culture project, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. Other creative projects, such as the Studio des Arts, and the transformation of the former municipal library and the former Danish Consulate, have also been carried out by the city, in a spirit of innovation and development.\nA large part of the annual cultural budget is allocated to support the music industries through numerous grants, especially for hosting of international events.
